NoAdsTelegram

Everything is configurable – you decide which parts of this unholy magic to enable.

Enable forwarding & saving – even on content that was locked down.
Enable saving stories – download and keep stories for later.
Disable sponsored messages – no more "promoted channels" cluttering your chat list.
Disable video ads – watch videos and stories ad‑free.
Disable message deletion – if someone said it, they said it. (a.k.a. anti‑recall)
Disable channel switching – prevent accidental channel changes via swipe or tap.
Hide stories section – out of sight, out of mind.
Hide pinned messages – clean up those chat headers, one less distraction.
Hide translate dialog – no more "Translate this message" popups.
Hide mute button – remove the mute notification button from chats.
Hide bottom overlay – hide the media/attachment overlay when you don't need it.
Disable swipe profile – stop accidentally opening profiles by swiping.
Disable swipe channel – disable swiping gestures on channels (for those with twitchy thumbs).

Compatibility: Works with the official Telegram app v12.4.1.
