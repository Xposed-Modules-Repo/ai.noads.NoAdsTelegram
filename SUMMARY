NoAdsTelegram

Everything is configurable – mix and match your perfect Telegram.

Enable forwarding & saving – even on content that was locked down.
Enable saving stories – download and keep stories for later.
Disable sponsored messages – no more "promoted channels" cluttering your chat list.
Disable video ads – watch videos ad‑free.
Disable message deletion – if someone said it, they said it. (a.k.a. anti‑recall)
Disable chat deletion – stop chats from disappearing… but beware: they might just come back after a restart. (Spoopy!)
Disable secret chat message deletion – keep those ephemeral messages forever.
Disable self‑destruct – self‑destruct timers now hit zero and just… stop. Like a movie cliffhanger.
Enable secret media save – save photos and videos from secret chats. Shhh.
Hide stories section – out of sight, out of mind.
Disable channel switching – prevent accidental channel changes via swipe or tap.
Hide pinned messages – clean up those chat headers.
Hide translate dialog – no more "Translate this" popups.
Hide mute button – remove the mute notification button from chats.
Hide bottom overlay – hide the bottom overlay when you don't need it.
Hide typing – stop showing "typing…" to others. Your thoughts, your secret.
Disable swipe profile – prevent accidentally closing the profile by swiping.
Disable swipe channel – disable swiping gestures on channels (for those with twitchy thumbs).

Compatibility: Works with the official Telegram app (tested on v12.4.1+).
